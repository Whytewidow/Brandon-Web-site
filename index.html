    <p class="three">Hello My name is brandon Garcelon and im here to tell you all about me. I have always been in love with computers and computer games since i was a kid ive been all consumed by fantasey worlds of all kinds and this curiosity and fasination grew into a passion of fantasy writing! in this pursuit of creating my own fantasey world i wanted to combine it with my other passion, video games. So my main driving factor in this pursuit of coding knowladge is to end up creating my own video game IP based on the story i wrote and coding it myself! if things go well maybe start my own studio! </p>
