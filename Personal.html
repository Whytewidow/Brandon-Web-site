   <Div><h1>The story and world of Anorah</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="three">The main reason behind wanting to move into coding and eventually software development is i created a world that i would like to turn into a video game! what started out as a short story turned into an ongoing novel that ive been writing for some time now. A high fantasy adventure with 8 differnt kingdoms 4+ continents and a vast erray of wild life that would make the hairs on youre neck stand up straight! ive pulled from real world religions and myths as well as a variety of the pagan myths and logos to form the world of Anorah!</p>

        <p>I will not be spoiling my story here but i can give you some basic information for you to understand the level of fantasy that will be in this story. This world is full of danger, from the plants to the climate and especially the creatures that inhabit this land. The seasons are all on the extream..There is no light rain, when it rains its torrential downpour or a monsoon, it doesnt just snow its a full on blizzard and the wind is at gale force when it gets "windy" here. this being said it is also home to the most breathe taking landscapes and scenery that you could possibly imagine. From floating moutian ranges, moving forrests, self scorthing woods and plains, heck even the islands formed themselves in the most accomidating way possible for the people of anorah to live at one with their element. with all this beauty theres always a force looking to corrupt and claim their dominion over it all! </p>
